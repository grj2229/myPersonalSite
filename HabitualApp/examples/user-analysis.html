              This interview was conducted with a first-year Wellesley student who has been remote since the pandemic began. Overall, she feels “settled in” with the new norms brought by Covid. The pandemic brought difficulties, such as halting her hobbies of dancing ballet and playing viola in orchestra, but she has also learned how to cope with this unusual situation. She knows everyone is in the same boat and tries her best to keep a good mindset. One way she does so is by keeping a gratitude journal where everyday she adds 5 things she’s grateful for and 5 things she loves about herself.
            </p>
            <p>
              It seems that changing her mindset to one of gratefulness and self-growth has also allowed her to feel more confident and prepared to step out of her comfort zones. Before college began, she felt very low motivation to do anything. There was no reason for her to get out of bed or to make a routine. But soon, her boredom brought new motivation, and she coped by keeping herself busy. She took her old hobbies and made adjustments. For example, she cleaned out her basement so she can have space to dance. Although she can’t do ballet, she has now expanded her repertoire of dance styles. In addition, she picked up many new hobbies. Whenever she found interest in something, she tried it out for about 2 weeks. She was a bit embarrassed that her new hobbies didn’t last long, but she said, “I don’t believe I need to stick with them for long. It’s just nice to try them out and to learn something new.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, it seems that self-motivation and personal growth has helped User 1 deal with the many challenges and changes brought by this past year. Having structure in her daily life also helped her enjoy accomplishments and grow more resilient.
            </p>
            
            <span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill mb-3">User 2</span>
            <p>
              This interview was conducted with a 17 year old who is a junior in high school. She has been living at home and taking remote classes for almost a year, and has found that it is difficult to separate her school/work routine from her social and home life. She says, “It’s really hard to find a good source of motivation now because I don’t have a good balance between my work life and my social life. I feel like [my social life] has been taken over by my work life. It’s been difficult and I’m susceptible to so many distractions at my house than I would be at school or at a library.” She tries to be more productive by not working in her bedroom because she associates that with resting. However, she still lacks a lot of motivation when it comes to getting up every day and having the same routine and says, “If I were at school, I’d constantly be moving and I’d go from school to the library or back home, and I’d shift between classes. But right now, it’s been difficult to stay in the same place and work for 10 hours straight.” It seems that a common theme of being unmotivated stems from her being unable to physically detach her school life from other social and non-academic interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her extracurriculars haven’t been very fulfilling either -- “there are times when I’m definitely not enjoying any of the extracurriculars that I’m doing because the only reason I did join them was because of the collaboration and fun traditions/experiences that come with doing clubs at school.” As mentioned above, she finds activities to be more fulfilling when they take place in a physical and social environment that is separate from her home environment. In terms of hobbies, she has taken up baking and cooking, and is grateful for being able to spend more time with family at home. She enjoys moments when she can go outside and take a break from the screen. She used to use TikTok and felt it was a good way for her generation to voice their opinions about the pandemic. She is also able to talk to her friends often using FaceTime, Zoom, and social media. However, she hasn’t “been able to talk to [her] friends in person yet a lot lately just because it’s junior year and everybody’s schedule is pretty hectic”, and they are all trying to navigate studying for standardized tests and taking AP classes online. Overall, it seems that she appreciates being able to relate with other people about common frustrations and has slowly adapted to new lifestyle changes caused by the pandemic.
            </p>

              This interview was conducted with a 20 year old college student. This student is struggling with managing a routine and staying consistent with it. She has goals she aims to accomplish weekly but has days where it feels more difficult to do things/ get out of bed. The stress and anxiety this user has is not being alleviated with being at home and having to be in control of their daily routine. She points out that it used to be easier in high school/ college when the routine was established for you but now making her schedule feels difficult. She finds herself stuck for some periods of time and in those moments to get back on track, she fixes bed, takes a shower, puts on makeup + baggy clothes, if really determined to go outside, and does laundry. Having a job creates a sense of financial security and also helps the user have moments to herself to get out of her house for mental health. Social media provides the user with an outlet to cope and maintain friendships she hopes to connect with, however it is not enough. Affording the means to be able to cope (with time/ resources) in moments they are stuck is not given to the user and also not many things that help or support her.

              To get through the days/ weeks the motivation the user has “is sheer willpower, it’s frustrating because when I run out of willpower for the day or week it's a wrap” While she had moments to reflect and take care of her well being/ health at the beginning of the pandemic, find her hobbies, the long term effects of the pandemic continues to affect the daily lives of this user and maintaining that consistency with her routine is not present.
